The Stars

She almost slips beneath the weight,
sinking into the gravity of her own undoing.
But the night is merciless with beauty,
pours galaxies into her eyes,
reminds her how small she is,
and how precious that smallness might be.

Constellations lean down,
call her by name in languages older than fire.
Their voices are cold and luminous,
arriving late
light delayed by millennia,
yet faithful enough to arrive at all.

And she wonders:
if they traveled so far,
endured silence, storms of dust,
the endless stretch of nothing
just to be seen,
just to pierce her window for a breath of a second
the least she can do
is lift her chin,
let them catch her gaze.

The longer she looks,
the more she feels tethered
a thread of light tying her
to every burning sun,
to sailors lost at sea,
to children making wishes
on falling embers.

Her chest aches with gravity.
She could collapse,
become her own black hole,
but still
a stubborn ember inside her refuses.
Because even the faintest star
is a kind of rebellion.

So she lingers,
not because life feels lighter,
but because the cosmos has conspired
to keep her here,
a fragile star herself,
burning in defiance
of the void.
