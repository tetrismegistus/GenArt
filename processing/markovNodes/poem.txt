The photograph shows two people in their bathrobes walking along a crowded side street in Chinatown. The street is covered in snow and the rooftops, too, are blanketed with white. The woman is a forlorn figure. She appears to be hurrying along, as if late for an appointment or missing the last streetcar home. In truth, she simply seems uncomfortable, unsure where to place her arms and afraid to touch the shopping bags of food she carries. Her face is hidden from us by the balloon of her collar, the brim of her hat and by the shoulder of her companion, who is a handsome, dark-haired man. At his side, he carries a small white dog. Both are seen walking away, some distance apart and as if each proceeds on an errand of his own. How am I to know this? Read the word on his shirt, walk. Was my father somehow walking? Look at the figures behind the lone woman and her dog man. At each turn of the street, they, too, leave a station to proceed on their way. The repetition itself mesmerizes. We are in mid-winter. All but this couple — the woman, the dog man and several others — have books and bags of food. Their destination does not appear to be desirable. Their exhaustion shows in their faces — in the eyes and corners of mouths. Their passage is a test of their endurance and ability to endure together. There is no evidence that, like the woman and dog man, they share the same destination. Would I have thought, She is on her way to the bathrobe man — or, the bathrobe man on his way to her? I think, No. Nothing would have occurred between them but distance. There is fear and that, too, is mysterious. There is the length of the journey and I think this is what makes me, her, sad and also angry.
