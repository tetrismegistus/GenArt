Generative Art Experiments

This repository is a collection of my generative art sketches, created over the years as part of my exploration into algorithmic and procedural creativity.  
Most sketches are written in the [Processing framework](https://processing.org/), with occasional experiments in other environments.

Originally intended primarily as a backup archive, it’s grown into a public record of my work.  
Pull requests, comments, issues, and suggestions are welcome — whether you’re offering code improvements, visual tweaks, or entirely new directions to explore.
